# MaidMatch Mobile Application
 
# 1.1 Introduction 
MaidMatch is a mobile application that primarily focuses on helping a working person that hardly finds a right time to clean their house as they usually took a rest during the weekend. Therefore, these people can easily order or find a maid through our application and immediately, the maid will be able to clean their client’s house quickly as the maid sent is usually near the house area. Moreover, the maids are all experienced in the cleaning industry hence the cleanliness and safety are guaranteed. 
Not only that, our application has permanently put a charge of money when hiring the maids. This avoids low payment to the maids that usually happens because they lack knowledge and people use that as an opportunity to benefit them. Therefore, this mobile application will surely help a lot of people in the future. 

# 1.2 Objective 
The objective of MaidMatch is to provide a convenient and efficient solution for busy working individuals to manage their housekeeping needs. We understand that with hectic work schedules and busy lifestyles, it can be difficult to find time to keep your home clean and organised. That's why we have developed MaidMatch to help people take control of their housekeeping tasks, even when they are not at home. 
MaidMatch will allow users to easily schedule cleaning appointments, hire housekeepers, and monitor the progress of their cleaning tasks. With our innovative features, users can customise their cleaning plans to suit their specific needs and preferences. They can choose from a wide range of cleaning services such as general cleaning, deep cleaning, and even specialised cleaning services like carpet cleaning or window washing. 
Users will have access to detailed information about the housekeepers, including their qualifications, experience, and customer ratings. This will give them the peace of mind knowing that their home is being taken care of by a trustworthy and professional housekeeper. 
Furthermore, we have incorporated an easy-to-use communication system, where users can ask for special requests or make changes to the cleaning schedule. We also have a feature that allows users to reschedule or cancel appointments if they need to make any changes. 
Overall, MaidMatch is designed to make housekeeping as easy and stress-free as possible. It's perfect for busy working individuals who want to have a clean and organised home,
but don't have the time to do it themselves. With MaidMatch, they can sit back, relax, and let us take care of the rest. 

# 1.3 Specification

# 2.0 Design Process and Intended Goal 
Observation → Ideation → Design 

➔ Observation - We categorise the designing process into three stages: observation, ideation, and design. To better grasp the demands of the population and the issue domain, we start by conducting some research. Following observation and analysis of these themes, we made the decision to create a maid finding application because we found out that in the current days and time, people are getting busier than ever. Not everyone could afford enough time to work, clean and take care of their family on the same day. A maid finder application could be useful for individuals or families who are looking for domestic workers to help with tasks such as cleaning, laundry, and childcare. It could also be useful for employers looking for domestic workers for their business such as cleaning companies and hotels. 

➔ Ideation - The idea of this application could make the process of finding a suitable maid more efficient and convenient. It could allow users to search for maids based on different criteria such as location, experience, and availability, and also provide reviews and ratings of the maids. Additionally, it could also include features such as scheduling and payment, making the process of hiring a maid more streamlined. 

➔ Design - Based on the research findings, the next step would be to create wireframes and prototypes for the app using a software called figma. These could include features such as:

1. A search function that allows users to filter maids based on criteria such as location, experience, and availability. 
2. Profiles for maids that include information such as their experience, skills, and ratings and reviews from previous clients 
3. A messaging or call function that allows users to communicate with maids directly
4. A scheduling and payment feature that allows users to book and pay for services directly through the app
5. A rating system that allows users to rate and review the service provided by the maids
6. A feature that allows maids to update their availability and see the schedules of their clients
